# Digital-Concept-Tutorial
## tutorial about Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary 
### tutorial level: Beginner 

Description: Create a tutorial in markdown that is hosted on GitHub and focuses on a digital concept, system, or process.

Purpose: This project provides experience working with markdown, Git/GitHub, and digital concepts.

Requirements:

This project is to be managed in a public GitHub repository. Submit the Clone with HTTPS URL for the repository that contains the tutorial.

The README.md is to serve as a home page for the tutorial. Other markdown pages can be linked to from the README.md. Provide navigation forward and backward if linking between markdown documents. Also, if useful, create links to navigate within a markdown document.

At the top of the README.md indicate the following information.

Title of the tutorial.
The author of the tutorial.
A brief summary of the purpose and content of the tutorial.
A description of the target audience for the tutorial.
The topic of the tutorial can be anything related to the content of the course. It can go beyond what is covered in the course, or it can be directed at a target audience that needs a more basic coverage of the material than provided in this course.

For the description of the target audience, indicate if it is directed at a particular age group, level of prior knowledge, etc.

With regard to size and scope, you should do a tutorial that can be completed in the last week of class. (Which, during the summer, is the equivalent of 2 weeks of a normal semester.) I am not looking for something very large or complicated. Whatever you focus on should be done well and have coverage of that thing.

Value
If you do a useful tutorial, it will be used by other students in future semesters.

It is a desirable skill in industry to be able to communicate to other people how to accomplish something.

This can be useful to have in the portfolio of materials hosted in your GitHub account as a demonstration of your knowledge and skills. Employers often ask for a prospective employee's GitHub account so they can see their work.

Submission
Submit the Clone with HTTPS URL for the repository as specified in the assignment.
